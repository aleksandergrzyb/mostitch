== 1. PREREQUISITES ==

 This project requires:
  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.6.2+
  * GNU Make or equivalent.
  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.

== 2. BUILDING ==
 
 This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

 NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
 generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

== 3. INSTALLING ==

 Once the project has been built (see "BUILDING"), execute "sudo make install".
